ABOUT THE TeklaResultsInterrogator APPLICATION

Program wraps an instantiation of the Menu class.
Initialization of Menu runs a script which will query the \Commands directory and grab all filenames and convert them to MenuOption objects (and Help and Quit).
The MenuOption object Names will then be displayed in the console, awaiting user input.
If the user input matches the name of a valid MenuOption, the InvokeCommand method will be invoked which instantiates an instance of the corresponding class from the Commands namespaceusing a parameterless constructor.
If this is successful, the Menu.Command property will expose this class to the Program.Main routine where it will be asynchronously initialized.

The BaseInterrogator class is the base class of all commands.
Commands that deal with member forces inherit properties from ForceInterrogator, which is derived from BaseInterrogator.
Commands that dela with nodal vibrations inherit properties from VibrationInterrogator, which is derived from BaseInterrogator.

Command names: green
Titles: dark cyan
Paths: yellow

Need some way to tell in each child class if in itialization of parent was successful (i.e., no null properties). If all properties are non-null, then the routine should continue. If any property is null, then the routine should exit with error.

What to do if multiple tekla files in the same folder?
